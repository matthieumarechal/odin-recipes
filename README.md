# odin-recipes
*Project website from Odin Project*
## Goal
The goal of this project is to review the basics of **HTML/CSS/JS + Git** by following the **ODIN PROJECT** tutorial.  
  
I am already familiar with these technologies, but I lack precision in certain areas and hope that this project will help me consolidate my knowledge.
